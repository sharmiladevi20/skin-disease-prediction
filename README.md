Skin Disease Prediction - Classify Skin Condition Using Image Datasets
1. Project Overview
Introduction
This project focuses on predicting and classifying various skin diseases using image datasets. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze dermatological images and provide automated diagnoses, aiding dermatologists and healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment.
Problem Statement
Skin diseases affect millions worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. However, access to dermatologists is limited in many areas. This project aims to address this issue by:
•	Using machine learning models to classify different skin conditions from images.
•	Providing an automated diagnosis system to assist healthcare professionals.
•	Enhancing accuracy in skin disease detection through deep learning.
Dataset Used
The project utilizes publicly available skin disease image datasets, including:
•	ISIC Dataset (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) for melanoma detection.
•	HAM10000 Dataset containing images of various skin conditions.
•	DermNet Dataset for a wide range of dermatological diseases.
